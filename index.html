          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
          is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
          example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
          its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
          Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators,
          control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
          for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;
          for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
            objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
            For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
            elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
            clicks, form input, and page navigation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
            objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
            server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
            database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
            another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
            server.

        <p>
          JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
          different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
          does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
          JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and
          basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed
          from LiveScript to JavaScript. <br />
          In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
          declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
          number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
          JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more
          common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides
          dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for
          individual objects. <br />JavaScript also supports functions without
          any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
          objects, executing as loosely typed methods. JavaScript is a very
          free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all
          variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with
          whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have
          to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return
          types are not explicitly typed.

        <header id="hello_world">Hello world</header>
        <p>
          To get started with writing <strong>JavaScript</strong>, open the
          Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
          function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
          greetMe("World"); Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch
          it unfold in your browser!

      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="variables">
        <header id="variables">Variables</header>
        <p>
          You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
          The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
          A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
          dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
          Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
          "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
          (lowercase). You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü
          in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
          characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
          Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

        <header id="variable_scope">Variable scope</header>
        <p>
          When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
          global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
          current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
          called a local variable, because it is available only within that
          function. JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block
          statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local
          to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For
          example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the
          function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the
          block, which in this case is an if statement. if (true) { var x = 5; }
          console.log(x); // 5 This behavior changes, when using the let
          declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015. if (true) { let y = 5; }
          console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="global_variables">
        <header id="global_variables">Global Variables</header>
        <p>
          Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
          pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global
          variables using the window.variable syntax. Consequently, you can
          access global variables declared in one window or frame from another
          window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example,
          if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can
          refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="constants">
        <header id="constants">Constants</header>
        <p>
          You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The
          syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
          identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and
          can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters. const PI =
          3.14; A constant cannot change value through assignment or be
          re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a
          value. The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let
          block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier
          is assumed to represent a variable. You cannot declare a constant with
          the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For
          example: // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; //
          THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
          //statements } However, object attributes are not protected, so the
          following statement is executed without problems. const MY_OBJECT =
          {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="data_types">
        <header id="data_types">Data types</header>
        <p>
          Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable
          you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and
          functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can
          think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as
          procedures that your application can perform.

          Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
          true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the
          condition is false. An if statement looks as follows: if (condition) {
          statement_1; } else { statement_2; } condition can be any expression
          that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of
          what evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true,
          statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed.
          statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including further
          nested if statements. You may also compound the statements using else
          if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows: if
          (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2; }
          else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; } In the
          case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which
          evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements,
          group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good
          practice to always use block statements, especially when nesting if
          statements: if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
          statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
          statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
          statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; } It is advisable to not use
          simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment
          can be confused with equality when glancing over the code. For
          example, do not use the following code: if (x = y) { /* statements
          here */ } If you need to use an assignment in a conditional
          expression, a common practice is to put additional parentheses around
          the assignment. For example: if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }
        </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
        <header id="while_statement">while statement</header>
        <p>
          A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified
          condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows: while
          (condition) statement If the condition becomes false, statement within
          the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following
          the loop. The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is
          executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the
          condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution
          stops and control is passed to the statement following while. To
          execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group
          those statements. Example: The following while loop iterates as long
          as n is less than three: var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; x
          += n; } With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value
          to x. Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
        </p>

        <header id="function_declorations">Function declarations</header>
        <p>
          A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
          statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by: The name of
          the function. A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in
          parentheses and separated by commas. The JavaScript statements that
          define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }. For example, the
          following code defines a simple function named square: function
          square(number) { return number * number; } The function square takes
          one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement
          that says to return the argument of the function (that is, number)
          multiplied by itself. The return statement specifies the value
          returned by the function. return number * number; Primitive parameters
          (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is
          passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the
          parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling
          function.
